The cost of transportation presents a number of challenges for low-income Washingtonians: making it harder to get a job, maintain a job, access social services, obtain healthcare, and care for their families. Building on the district's other initiatives to address cost as a barrier to transit equity, such as the Mayor's 2019 Free Circulator bus trial and Kids Ride Free program, the District and WMATA are conducting a randomized evaluation of free and discounted transit fares. We will look at the impact of cost on low-income residents' public transit use and overall well-being. The findings may inform intiatives that make public transit more accessible to low-income residents.

## Why is this issue important in DC?
{: .lead}

Although some DC government programs and nonprofits provide transit stipends, low-income adults in DV are not currently eligible as a group for a discounted fare. Lowering the cost of fares for low-income riders can increase public transit use and job search activity, but what does increased access to transit mean for residents' quality of life? Given that providing this type of discount is costly, it's important that DC first study its impact and cost-effectiveness before considering a wider roll-out.
